# Layer specification

Below is the full specification for a Pebble configuration layer. Layers are added statically using a file in `$PEBBLE/layers`, or dynamically via the layers API or `pebble add`.

```yaml
# (Optional) A short one line summary of the layer
summary: <summary>

# (Optional) A full description of the configuration layer

# (Optional) A list of services managed by this configuration layer
services:

    <service name>:

        # (Required) Control how this service definition is combined with any
        # other pre-existing definition with the same name in the Pebble plan.
        #
        # The value 'merge' will ensure that values in this layer specification
        # are merged over existing definitions, whereas 'replace' will entirely
        # override the existing service spec in the plan with the same name.
        override: merge | replace

        # (Required in combined layer) The command to run the service. It is executed
        # directly, not interpreted by a shell, and may be optionally suffixed by default
        # arguments within "[" and "]" which may be overriden via --args.
        # Example: /usr/bin/somedaemon --db=/db/path [ --port 8080 ]

        # For the health endpoint, ready implies alive. In other words, if all
        # the "ready" checks are succeeding and there are no "alive" checks,
        # the /v1/health API will return success for level=alive.
        level: alive | ready

            # settings, and working directory. The check's context (the

    location: <url>

    # (Optional) A list of services whose logs will be sent to this target.
    # Use the special keyword 'all' to match all services in the plan.
    # When merging log targets, the 'services' lists are appended. Prefix a
    # service name with a minus (e.g. '-svc1') to remove a previously added
    # service. '-all' will remove all services.
    services: [<service names>]

    # (Optional) A list of key/value pairs defining labels which should be set
