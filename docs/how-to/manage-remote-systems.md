# How to use Pebble to manage remote systems

Managing a cluster of servers remotely is no mean task. It is not only time-consuming since servers need regular software updates, configuration changes, file transfers, and command executions, but it also presents security challenges because remote access requires opening ports, which increases the potential attack surface.

While it's possible to manually execute commands on remote servers and transfer files from/to remote servers, it is not the most efficient (or secure) approach. Several other methods exist for remote command execution and system administration. Secure Shell (SSH) is one of them, and there are also dedicated configuration management tools like Ansible. However, to use these tools, an extra port for SSH needs to be opened, which not only increases the operational overhead of managing public/private keys but also the potential attack surface.

## Pebble in remote systems

Pebble provides various commands and APIs to run commands and manage files and directories in remote systems. With these capabilities, if we run Pebble in a remote system like in a separate container, we can use Pebble APIs to coordinate with the remote system without opening a new port.

---

## Run commands in remote systems

One common task in system administration is updating and installing packages on remote servers. With Pebble, we can use the `pebble exec` command to achieve this.

For example, if Pebble is running with a user with root privilege, we can use this command to update and install packages in remote systems:

```{terminal}
:input: pebble exec apt update
Hit:1 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble InRelease
Get:2 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble-updates InRelease [126 kB]
Get:3 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble-backports InRelease [126 kB]
...
Fetched 3121 kB in 38s (81.5 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
41 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
```

To install a package, run:

```bash
pebble exec apt install cowsay
```

To confirm the package is successfully installed in the remote system, run:

```{terminal}
:input: pebble exec cowsay moo
 _____
< moo >
 -----
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

For more information on the Pebble `exec` command, see {ref}`reference_pebble_exec_command`.

## Manage files in remote systems

Another common task in remote systems is configuration management, like updating configuration files, pushing files to the servers, pulling files generated by running services, and so on.

With Pebble, this can be done easily. For example, if we want to install Nginx, create our own website, and serve it on a newly created virtual host, we can first install Nginx:

```bash
pebble exec apt install nginx
```

Then create our website _locally_:

```bash
echo "Hello, Pebble!" > /tmp/index.html
```

Create a directory in the remote system:

```bash
pebble mkdir -p /var/www/pebble
```

Push our local website file to the remote system:

```bash
pebble push /tmp/index.html /var/www/pebble/index.html
```

Create a virtual host configuration _locally_:

```
cat <<EOF > /tmp/pebble
server {
       listen 81;
       listen [::]:81;

       server_name example.ubuntu.com;

       root /var/www/pebble;
       index index.html;

       location / {
               try_files \$uri \$uri/ =404;
       }
}
EOF
```

Push the file to the remote system:

```bash
pebble push /tmp/pebble /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pebble
```

Activate the newly added virtual host in the remote system by restarting Nginx:

```bash
pebble exec service nginx restart
```

Finally, we can test the final result:

```{terminal}
:input: curl localhost:81
Hello, Pebble!
```

- {ref}`reference_pebble_mkdir_command`
- {ref}`reference_pebble_rm_command`
- {ref}`reference_pebble_push_command`
- {ref}`reference_pebble_pull_command`

## Use Pebble APIs

In previous sections, we used Pebble commands to execute commands and manage files. For automation purposes, we can also do the same with Pebble API.

For example, to push a file to the remote system, we can POST to the `/v1/files` endpoint:

```bash
curl --unix-socket $PEBBLE/.pebble.socket -XPOST localhost:4000/v1/files -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F request='{"action": "write", "files": [{"path": "/var/www/pebble/index.html", "make-dirs": true, "permissions": "644"}]}' -F 'files=@/tmp/index.html;type=application/octet-stream;filename=/var/www/pebble/index.html'
```

In this guide, we used Pebble commands and curl to access the APIs. We can also access Pebble API using the Go client and Python client. For more information, see [How to use the Pebble API to manage services](/how-to/use-the-pebble-api).

For more information on the API, read the [API spec](/reference/api).
