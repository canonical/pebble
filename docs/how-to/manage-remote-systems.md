# How to use Pebble to manage remote systems

Managing a cluster of servers remotely is no mean task. It is not only time-consuming since servers need regular software updates, configuration changes, file transfer, and command executions, but also presents security challenges because remote access requires opening ports which increases the potential attack surface.

While it's possible to manually execute commands on remote servers and transfer files from/to remote servers, it is not the most efficient (or secure) approach. There exist several other methods for remote command execution and system administration. Secure Shell (SSH) is one of them, and there are also dedicated configuration management tools like Ansible. However, to use these tools, an extra port for SSH needs to be opened, which not only increases the operational overhead of managing public/private keys but also the potential attack surface.

## Pebble in remote systems

Pebble provides various commands and APIs to run commands and manage files and directories in remote systems. With these capabilities, if we run Pebble in a remote system like in a separate container, we can use Pebble APIs coordinate with the remote system without opening a new port.

To know more about Pebble APIs, read [API and clients](/explanation/api-and-clients) and the [API spec](/reference/api).

## Run commands in remote systems

One common task in system administration is to update and install packages in remote servers. With Pebble, we can use the `pebble exec` command to achieve this.

For example, if Pebble is running with a user with root privilege, we can use this command to update and install packages in remote systems:

```{terminal}
:input: pebble exec apt update
Hit:1 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble InRelease
Get:2 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble-updates InRelease [126 kB]
Get:3 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports noble-backports InRelease [126 kB]
...
Fetched 3121 kB in 38s (81.5 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
41 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
```

To install a package, run:

```bash
pebble exec apt install cowsay
```

To confirm the package is successfully installed in the remote system, run:

```{terminal}
:input: pebble exec cowsay moo
 _____
< moo >
 -----
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

## Manage files in remote systems

Another common task in remote systems is configuration management, like updating configuration files, pushing files to the servers, pulling files generated by running services, and so on.

With Pebble, this can be done easily. For example, if we want to install Nginx, create our own website, and serve it on a newly created virtual host, we can first install Nginx:

```bash
pebble exec apt install nginx
```

Then create our website:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/pebble

sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /var/www/pebble/index.html
Hello, Pebble!
EOF'
```

Create a virtual host configuration _locally_:

```
cat <<EOF > ~/pebble
server {
       listen 81;
       listen [::]:81;

       server_name example.ubuntu.com;

       root /var/www/pebble;
       index index.html;

       location / {
               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
}
EOF
```

Push the file to the remote system:

```bash
pebble push ~/pebble /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pebble
```

Activate the newly added virtual host:

```bash
pebble exec service nginx restart
```

And test our result:

```{terminal}
:input: curl localhost:81
Hello, Pebble!
```
