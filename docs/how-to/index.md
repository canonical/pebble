# How-to guides

These guides walk you through key operations you can perform with Pebble.


## Installation

Installation follows a similar pattern on all architectures. You can choose to install the pre-built binary or build it from the source by yourself.

## Service orchestration

As your needs grow, you may want to orchestrate multiple services.

## Logging

To better understand the operation of the services, you may need to work with logs.

## Identities

Use named "identities" to allow additional users to access the API.
