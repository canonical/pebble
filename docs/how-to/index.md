# How-to guides

These guides walk you through key operations you can perform with Pebble.


## Installation

Installation follows a similar pattern on all architectures. You can choose to install the pre-built binary or build it from the source by yourself.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
:maxdepth: 1

Install Pebble <install-pebble>
```

## Service orchestration

As your needs grow, you may want to use advanced Pebble features to run services reliably and orchestrate multiple services.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
:maxdepth: 1

Run services reliably <run-services-reliably>
Manage service dependencies <service-dependencies>
Use layers <use-layers>
```


## Manage a remote system

Pebble provides exec and file management functions to coordinate with remote systems.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
:maxdepth: 1

Manage a remote system <manage-a-remote-system>
```


## Logging

To better understand the operation of the services, you may need to work with logs.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
:maxdepth: 1

Forward logs to Loki <forward-logs-to-loki>
```


## Identities

Use named "identities" to allow additional users to access the API.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
:maxdepth: 1

Manage identities <manage-identities>
```


## API

To integrate Pebble with your automated workflows, you can use the Pebble API.
