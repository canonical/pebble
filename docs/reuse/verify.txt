Start: Verify the Pebble installation

Once the installation is complete, verify that `pebble` has been installed correctly by running:

```bash
pebble
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```{terminal}
   :input: pebble
   :user: user
   :host: host
   :dir: ~
Pebble lets you control services and perform management actions on
the system that is running them.

Usage: pebble <command> [<options>...]

...
```

End: Verify the Pebble installation
