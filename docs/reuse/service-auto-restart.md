Start: Service auto-restart note

```{note}
By default, if a service exits, Pebble will restart it after the backoff delay, which defaults to half a second. The backoff delay can be configured, refer to [Layer specification](/reference/layer-specification.md) for more details. The default auto-restart behaviour can also be configured according to the service's exit code, refer to [Service auto-restart](/reference/service-auto-restart.md) and [Layer specification](/reference/layer-specification.md) for more information.
```

End: Service auto-restart note
