Hacking on Pebble is easy. It's written in Go, so install or [download](https://golang.org/dl/) a copy of the latest version of Go. Pebble uses [Go modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod) for managing dependencies, so all of the standard Go tooling just works.

To compile and run Pebble, use the `go run` command on the `cmd/pebble` directory. The first time you run it, it will download dependencies and build packages, so will take a few seconds (but after that be very fast):

```
$ go run ./cmd/pebble
Pebble lets you control services and perform management actions on
the system that is running them.

Usage: pebble <command> [<options>...]
...
```

If you want to build and install the executable to your `~/go/bin` directory (which you may want to add to your path), use `go install`:

```
$ go install ./cmd/pebble
```

However, during development it's easiest just to use `go run`, as that will automatically recompile if you've made any changes.


## Running the daemon

To run the Pebble daemon, set the `$PEBBLE` environment variable and use the `pebble run` sub-command, something like this:

```
$ mkdir ~/pebble
$ export PEBBLE=~/pebble
$ go run ./cmd/pebble run
2021-09-15T01:37:23.962Z [pebble] Started daemon.
...
```


## Using the CLI client

The use the Pebble command line client, run one of the other Pebble sub-commands, such as `pebble plan` or `pebble services` (if the server is running in one terminal, do this in another):

```
$ export PEBBLE=~/pebble
$ go run ./cmd/pebble plan
services:
    snappass:
        override: replace
        command: sleep 60

$ go run ./cmd/pebble services
Service   Startup   Current
snappass  disabled  inactive
```


## Using Curl to hit the API

For debugging, you can also use [curl](https://curl.se/) in unix socket mode to hit the Pebble API:

```
$ curl --unix-socket ~/pebble/.pebble.socket 'http://localhost/v1/services?names=snappass' | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   120  100   120    0     0   117k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  117k
{
  "type": "sync",
  "status-code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "result": [
    {
      "name": "snappass",
      "startup": "disabled",
      "current": "inactive"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Code style

### Commits

Please format your commits following the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) style.

Optionally, use the brackets to scope to a particular component where applicable.

See below for some examples of commit headings:

```
feat: checks inherit context from services
test: increase unit test stability
feat(daemon): foo the bar correctly in the baz
test(daemon): ensure the foo bars correctly in the baz
ci(snap): upload the snap artefacts to Github
chore(deps): update go.mod dependencies
```

Recommended prefixes are: `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`,`perf:` and `test:`

### Imports

Pebble imports should be arranged in three groups:
- standard library imports
- third-party / non-Pebble imports
- Pebble imports (i.e. those prefixed with `github.com/canonical/pebble`)

Imports should be sorted alphabetically within each group.

We use the [`gopkg.in/check.v1`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/check.v1) package for testing. Inside a test file, import this as follows:
```go
. "gopkg.in/check.v1"
```
so that identifiers from that package will be added to the local namespace.


Here is an example of correctly arranged imports:

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
	"os"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	. "gopkg.in/check.v1"

	"github.com/canonical/pebble/internals/systemd"
	"github.com/canonical/pebble/internals/testutil"
)
```

### Log and error messages

**Log messages** (that is, those passed to `logger.Noticef` or `logger.Debugf`) should begin with a capital letter, and use "Cannot X" rather than "Error Xing":
```go
logger.Noticef("Cannot marshal logs to JSON: %v", err)
```

**Error messages** should be lowercase, and again use "cannot ..." instead of "error ...":
```go
fmt.Errorf("cannot create log client: %w", err)
```


## Running the tests

Pebble has a suite of Go unit tests, which you can run using the regular `go test` command. To test all packages in the Pebble repository:

```
$ go test ./...
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/client  (cached)
?       github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd [no test files]
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble  0.095s
...
```

To test a single package, simply pass the package path to `go test`:

```
$ go test ./cmd/pebble
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble  0.115s
```

To run a single suite or a single test, pass the suite or test name to the [gocheck](https://labix.org/gocheck) test runner:

```
$ go test ./cmd/pebble -v -check.v -check.f PebbleSuite
=== RUN   Test
PASS: cmd_add_test.go:38: PebbleSuite.TestAdd   0.002s
PASS: format_test.go:52: PebbleSuite.TestCanUnicode 0.000s
...
PASS: cmd_version_test.go:26: PebbleSuite.TestVersionCommand    0.000s
OK: 20 passed
--- PASS: Test (0.02s)
PASS
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble  0.022s

$ go test ./cmd/pebble -v -check.v -check.f PebbleSuite.TestAdd
=== RUN   Test
PASS: cmd_add_test.go:38: PebbleSuite.TestAdd   0.002s
OK: 1 passed
--- PASS: Test (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble  0.007s
```

Note that during CI we run the tests with `-race` to catch data races:

```
$ go test -race ./...
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/client  (cached)
?       github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd [no test files]
ok      github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble  0.165s
...
```


## Creating a release

To create a new tagged release, go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/canonical/pebble/releases) and:

- Update `Version` in `cmd/version.go` to the version you're about to publish, for example `v1.9.0`. Push this to master (or open a PR to do so).
- Click ["Draft a new release"](https://github.com/canonical/pebble/releases/new).
- Enter the version tag (eg: `v1.9.0`) and select "Create new tag: on publish".
- Enter a release title: include the version tag and a short summary of the release.
- Write release notes: describe new features and bug fixes, and include a link to the full list of commits.
- Click "Publish release".
- Once the release GitHub Actions have finished, and the new [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/pebble) has been successfully built, update `Version` again to `v1.{next}.0-dev` (for example `v1.10.0-dev`).

Binaries will be created and uploaded automatically to this release by the [binaries.yml](https://github.com/canonical/pebble/blob/master/.github/workflows/binaries.yml) GitHub Actions job. In addition, a new Snap version is built and uploaded to the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/pebble).
