summary: Pebble - take control of your internal daemons!
description: |
  Pebble helps you to orchestrate a set of local service processes
  as an organized set. It resembles well-known tools such as supervisord,
  runit, or s6, in that it can easily manage non-system processes
  independently from the system services, but it was designed with unique
  features that help with more specific use cases.

  **Usage**

  * The Pebble snap's default directory is
  `$HOME/snap/pebble/<rev>/var/lib/pebble/default`. This directory is **not**
  created at installation time.

  **Documentation**
