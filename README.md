## Take control of your internal daemons!

**Pebble** helps you to orchestrate a set of local service processes as an organized set.
It resembles well known tools such as _supervisord_, _runit_, or _s6_, in that it can
easily manage non-system processes independently from the system services, but it was
designed with unique features that help with more specific use cases.

## General model

Pebble is organized as a single binary that works as a daemon and also as a
client to itself. When the daemon runs it loads its own configuration from the
`$PEBBLE` directory, as defined in the environment, and also writes down in
that same directory its state and Unix sockets for communication. If that variable
is not defined, Pebble will attempt to look for its configuration from a default
system-level setup at `/var/lib/pebble/default`. Using that directory is encouraged
for whole-system setup such as when using Pebble to control services in a container.

The `$PEBBLE` directory must contain a `layers/` subdirectory that holds a stack of
configuration files with names similar to `001-base-layer.yaml`, where the digits define
the order of the layer and the following label uniquely identifies it. Each
layer in the stack sits above the former one, and has the chance to improve or
redefine the service configuration as desired.

## Layer configuration examples

This is a complete example of the current [configuration format](#layer-specification):

```yaml
summary: Simple layer

description: |
    A better description for a simple layer.

services:
    srv1:
        override: replace
        summary: Service summary
        command: cmd arg1 "arg2a arg2b"
        startup: enabled
        after:
            - srv2
        before:
            - srv3
        requires:
            - srv2
            - srv3
        environment:
            VAR1: val1
            VAR2: val2
            VAR3: val3

    srv2:
        override: replace
        startup: enabled
        command: cmd
        before:
            - srv3

    srv3:
        override: replace
        command: cmd
```

Some details worth highlighting:

  - The `startup` option can be `enabled` or `disabled`.
  - There is the `override` field (for now required) which defines whether this 
entry _overrides_ the previous service of the same name (if any - missing is 
okay), or merges with it.

### Layer override example

Any of the fields can be replaced individually in a merged service configuration.
To illustrate, here is a sample override layer that might sit atop the one above:

```yaml
summary: Simple override layer

services:
    srv1:
        override: merge
        environment:
            VAR3: val3
        after:
            - srv4
        before:
            - srv5

    srv2:
        override: replace
        summary: Replaced service
        startup: disabled
        command: cmd

    srv4:
        override: replace
        command: cmd
        startup: enabled

    srv5:
        override: replace
        command: cmd
```

## Running pebble

Once the `$PEBBLE` directory is setup, running it is easy:

    $ pebble run

This will start the pebble daemon itself, and start all default services as well. Then
other pebble commands may be used to interact with the running daemon.

For example, to see any recent changes, for this or previous runs, use:

    $ pebble changes

And start or stop a specific service with:

    $ pebble start <name1> [<name2> ...]
    $ pebble stop  <name1> [<name2> ...]

## Layer specification

```yaml
# (Optional) A short one line summary of the layer
summary: <summary>

# (Optional) A full description of the configuration layer
description: |
    <description>

# (Required) A list of services managed by this configuration layer
services:

    <service name>:

        # (Required) Control how this service definition is combined with any
        # other pre-existing definition with the same name in the Pebble plan.
        #
        # The value 'merge' will ensure that values in this layer specification
        # are merged with existing definitions, where 'override' will replace
        # and existing service spec in the plan with the same name
        override: merge | replace

        # (Optional) A short summary of the service
        summary: <summary>

        # (Optional) A detailed description of the service
        description: |
            <description>

        # (Optional) The command to run the service.
        # Example: /usr/bin/somecommand -b -t 30
        command: <commmand>

        # (Optional) Control whether the service is started automatically when
        # Pebble starts. 
        startup: enabled | disabled

        # (Optional) A list of other services in the plan that this service
        # should start after
        after:
            - <other service name>

        # (Optional) A list of other services in the plan that this service
        # should start before
        before:
            - <other service name>

        # (Optional) A list of other services in the plan that this service
        # requires in order to start correctly    
        requires:
            - <other service name>

        # (Optional) A list of key/value pairs defining environment variables
        # that should be set in the context of the process
        environment:
            <env var name>: <env var value>
```

## TODO/Contributing

This is a preview of what Pebble is becoming. Please keep that in mind while you
explore around.

Here are some of the things coming soon:

- [x] Support `$PEBBLE_SOCKET` and default `$PEBBLE` to `/var/lib/pebble/default`
- [x] Define and enforce convention for layer names
- [x] Dynamic layer support over the API
- [x] Configuration retrieval commands to investigate current settings
- [x] Status command that displays active services and their current status
- [x] General system modification commands (writing configuration files, etc)
- [ ] Improve signal handling, e.g., sending SIGHUP to a service
- [ ] Terminate all services before exiting run command
- [ ] More tests for existing CLI commands
- [ ] Better log caching and retrieval support
- [ ] Consider showing unified log as output of `pebble run`

## Have fun!

... and enjoy the rest of 2021!
