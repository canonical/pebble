_Take control of your internal daemons!_

**Pebble** is a lightweight Linux service manager that helps you orchestrate a set of local processes as an organized set. It resembles well-known tools such as _supervisord_, _runit_, or _s6_, in that it can easily manage non-system processes independently from the system services. However, it was designed with unique features such as layered configuration and an HTTP API that help with more specific use cases.

Pebble's key features:

- [Layer](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/layer-specification/)-based configuration
- Service [dependencies](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/explanation/service-dependencies/)
- Service [logs](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/cli-commands/#logs) and [log forwarding](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/log-forwarding/)
- [Health checks](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/health-checks/)
- [Notices](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/notices/) (aggregated events)
- [Identities](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/how-to/manage-identities/)
- Can be used in [virtual machines and containers](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/how-to/manage-a-remote-system/)
- [CLI commands](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/reference/cli-commands/)
- [HTTP API](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pebble/explanation/api-and-clients/) with a [Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/canonical/pebble/client) and a [Python client](https://github.com/canonical/operator/blob/main/ops/pebble.py)

## Quick start

At any Linux shell:

```bash
go install github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble@latest
mkdir -p ~/.config/pebble/layers
export PEBBLE=$HOME/.config/pebble

echo """\
services:
    demo-service:
        override: replace
        command: sleep 1000
        startup: enabled
""" > $PEBBLE/layers/001-demo-service.yaml

pebble run
```
