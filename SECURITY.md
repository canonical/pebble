# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security updates will be released for all major versions that have had releases in the last year,
and for all versions of Pebble that are bundled with [Juju](https://github.com/juju/juju)
releases that [receive security updates](https://juju.is/docs/juju/roadmap).

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please provide a description of the issue, the steps you took to
create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for
the issue.

The easiest way to report a security issue is through
[GitHub's security advisory for this project](https://github.com/canonical/pebble/security/advisories/new). See
[Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions on reporting using GitHub's security advisory feature.

The Pebble GitHub admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you
to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in
which component. We will then figure out a fix, get a CVE
assigned, and coordinate the release of the fix.

You may also send email to security@ubuntu.com. Email may optionally be
encrypted to OpenPGP key
[`4072 60F7 616E CE4D 9D12 4627 98E9 740D C345 39E0`](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x407260f7616ece4d9d12462798e9740dc34539e0)

If you have a deadline for public disclosure, please let us know.
Our vulnerability management team intends to respond within 3 working
days of your report. This project aims to resolve all vulnerabilities
within 90 days.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo
policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more
information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we
expect from you.
